#+TITLE: Music Theory Course for RMA
#+AUTHOR: Matt Hood

* Principles
- Guided self-discovery via interactivity
- Aural training is essential for understanding music theory.
- Avoid teaching common practise harmony. Focus instead on jazz and pop. In the latter case, investigate cyclic chord progressions as discussed by 12tone, Neely, etc.

Pertaining to organisation of this document
** :proposal:
An idea that seems good, but may well have alternatives that are better
** :openquestion:
An assumption about which I feel unsure, and could use some input from others
** :activity:
A topic that could use some interactive demonstration
** :explanation:
A topic that will be explained to students.
** :problem:
An explanation is missing its pre-requisite

* Ideas
** DONE Note picker that is able to illustrate the process of moving from continuous frequency space to discrete notes that work well together
**Why?** Sound is a wilderness of discordance and dissonance. The machinery of tuning, scales, chords is all about finding the 'good notes', the subset of dissonance that is consonance. This exercise gives the student an appreciation of the value of elementary music theory, by experiencing how bad things are without it. This will then be a source of motivation to continue learning.
** TODO Lines connecting the keys in the keyboard graphic.
** TODO Dots on the fretboard graphic
** TODO Make clickable versions of the keyboard, fretboard and chromatic graphics; then have exercises to select the correct notes.

** DONE Live sequence that allows manipulation of rhythm, timbre and pitch

** TODO Intervals: Assign an emotional adjective to each interval (or any aural object really) and use the rest of the presentation

Aural Interval objects could be placed inline with text, featuring
- Official term as text
- Student-prescribed adjective
- Student-prescribed colour
- Plays the sound, with a random root note for relative objects


** DONE For relative pitch: play a song in a random key - first through earphones, then everyone together - note that they can still recognise the song even though the notes are totally different.




** Homework
*** TODO A separate presentation that gives homework in between sessions. :proposal:

** TODO Knowledge tree                                            :proposal:
Duolingo-style tree that shows progress through the study plan


* Outline
** Where to put note names? Initially I was thinking at the beginning, but what if we ditched note names until later? It would really hammer home the relative pitch idea. Many people initally fail to fully appreciate that tonal music theory works the same in any key. :openquestion:

* Lecture 1: Ear training 

** Elements of sound, and what we're focusing on
*** Timbre
**** The /sound/ of a sound. If you play the same note on a piano, on a guitar, and on a saxophone, you can tell the difference between them. Timbre is that difference. :explanation:
*** Rhythm
**** For a given note, if you're thinking about when it starts and how long it goes for, you're thinking about rhythm. Rhythm can be steady and predictable as in rock or dance music, or flowy and unpredictable as in classical music. :explanation:
*** Pitch
**** This one is the easiest to hear and the hardest to define (luckily, they'll be hearing it), so we're going to focus on building an intuition for it. The purpose of this course is teach you some of the tools and strategies we have for choosing and organising our pitches. :explanation:
**** Should I add a disclaimer about this being the set of tools inherited from european art music, and used in contemporary western music? :openquestion:
*** Three sliders, one for each of timbre, rhythm and pitch. A sequence can be manipulated live to change each of these musical characterists independently. :activity:


** "Where are the good notes?"
*** Continuous to discrete frequency spectrum :activity:
The words used here are consciously used without definition; terms will be clarified later.
1. Continuous: Makes you kind of nauseous
2. Chromatic scale: Not exactly a pleasant melody, but not quite so nauseating either.
3. Major scale: Sounds melodic and recognisable.
4. Major chord: Undeniably pleasant, lacks even the tension and interest of the diatonic.
*** (1) There are an uncountably infinite number of pitches to choose from, and I'm not just referring to sounds that are perhaps too low or too high for a human to hear. For any pitch you choose, there are an infinite amount of pitches that are really close to it, and most of them will sound, as we often say, "out of tune". So if you just pick two pitches at random, your chances of picking two that sound good together are actually pretty low. You could say, at this stage, that our pitch is 'continuous' (as in the applet). :explanation:
*** Examples of music that uses continuous pitch: 1) A child's first violin lesson 2) The theremin 3) Happy birthday :example:

*** (2) So what we do is we reduce our options; we choose a finite number of pitches that work 'well' together. Mathematicians, engineers and pioneering music theorists have done the legwork for us here. For those of us who play instruments such piano, guitar, harp (...) - instruments with fixed pitches such as keys, frets or a bunch of strings - we get these notes for free. Other instruments such as vocals, violin, trumpet require training for a player to be able to hit these particular notes. This set of notes is known as the 'chromatic scale'; from the Greek prefix 'chroma' meaning colour. The chromatic scale is a palette, holding all the musical colours available to us. :explanation:
*** Play an example of ascending-descending chromatic scale :example:

*** It's here that our course truly begins. We're going to take the chromatic scale for granted, since it has been given to us by our instruments, and use it to reach our musical goals. By the end of this module, you'll understand how (3) and (4) have come about.

** Relative pitch vs absolute. Need to include these defintitions? :openquestion:
*** A song played in different keys is still recognisable. Why?  :activity:
1. Listen once with earphones in
2. Unplug earphones, play again, listen to everyone else's
3. Plug earphones back in
*** For the 99% of us without perfect pitch, one note is as good as another. A note by itself has no intrinsic emotional value, and we're unable tell notes apart, beyond 'high'-ish or 'low'-ish. :explanation:
*** Demonstrate lack of emotion in one long tone. :example:
*** So how can we possibly experience music?
*** It turns out the what we're really hearing when we listen to music is the **distance** between the notes. Our experience is based on how much lower or higher a note is from the ones that came before it. This is why we're recognise the same song built out of totally different notes: as long as the distances between the notes stay the same, we can still recognise the tune. :explanation:
** Tones and semitones
*** Like any measurement of distance, we need to gain an intuition for the units. I know that a kilometre is a distance that I can walk in ten minutes, and that the ground is bit less than six feet below my eyes. But 300 yards? I'm not sure whether I want to carry that groceries that far. :explanation:
*** So you can see that it's going to be important for us to really understand and appreciate certain measurements of musical distance.
*** We measure the distance between notes by counting the amount of steps seperating them on the chromatic scale. :explanation:
*** Include a graphic with three different chromatic visualisations:
- Multicolour staircase
- Pseudo-keyboard
- Pseudo-fretboard
*** We're going to define two units that are worth knowing about. A 'semitone' is one step of the chromatic scale; a 'tone' is two steps.
*** Learn to recognise :activity:
*** Learn to recognise multiple in a row :activity:
** What can we build with tones and semitones?
*** Scales, using sequences of tones, semitones: 
**** Take a random sequence of 7 tones and semitones to get different scale :activity:
**** Give an example of the 'major' scale and the 'minor' scale. Emphasise that this is foreshadowing, rather than something they should fully understand, since the significance of these scales cannot be appreciated with the explanations given so far. :explanation:
**** This was step (3) (in the frequency resolution applet)
*** Chords, by combining tones, semitones to create bigger musical distances:
**** Same as above: random sequence of 3 tone/semitone + tone/semitone combinations to build different chords :activity:
**** Give examples of 'major' and 'minor' chord. This one is a little less arcane, since they will have played major and minor chords. Potential confusion around the common naming (major, minor) so reassure that this will be explained later. :explanation:
**** This was step (4) (in the frequency resolution applet)

*** Intervals, by combining an arbitrary number of tones/semitones:
**** The work for this one will be done in the next module, so just give a few examples :activity:
**** Since tone = semitone + semitone, note that it is easier to just use semitones when defining intervals. :explanation:


* Lecture 2:  What is it all for?
** What if we don't introduce major/minor n-th? Just use eg, b3, 2, #4 :openquestion:
** Things are still pretty basic so far, many people may already be familiar with the content from at least the first and second lectures. Should this be addressed? :openquestion:
** You'd want someone to be able to recognise all the intervals to consider them having completed basic ear training. Could you skip from tones and semitones to major/minor scales and major minor chords?  :openquestion:
Essentially boils down to: can someone tell the difference a) between intervals, scales and chords aurally ) b) and major/minor in each category; without having learned all of the intervals?
If so, it may turn out easier to recognise e.g. a b6 if they've already heard it in the minor scale they can recognise.
This would follow the lecture content better.
** Flashcard reinforcement to memorise these constructions? :proposal:

** TODO Introduction
*** We've established so far

** Scales, built from tones/semitones
All with respect to a root note. Is this better than tone-semitone? Obscures the relative minor/major relationship, but I think that might be a red herring.

Give fretboard/keyboard/stack examples. Note that the notes can appear in any order.

Important: Each letter of the musical alphabet is represented

*** Note how I didn't say "Gb" or "Db" - one rule, one convention we have is that each letter of the musical alphabet is represented exactly once in any major scale. This helps keep things consistent, and make it easier to remember which notes can be found in a key. :explanation:

*** !! Note the circular defintion. Scales are defined here in terms of intervals (minor 3rd, major 6th), but the intervals are named by the scale degree on which they are used
*** Major (T-T-S-T-T-T-S)
*** Minor (T-S-T-T-S-T-T)
*** Get them to trace along with their fingers as the example plays (when stack is shown), to perhaps gain a better intuition for how tones/semitones sound in context :activity:
*** Also, play the scales on one's instrument :activity:

** Chords, built from tones/semitones

Give fretboard/keyboard/stack examples of each. Pull out actual notes.
Note that these notes can appear in any order.
*** Major (T-T, T-S)
*** Guitarists might be furrowing their brows - doesn't my E major chord have six notes - not three? If you look at the note on each string, you'll see that there are still only three unique notes all up. E and B are repeated a few times. :explanation:
*** Minor (T-S, T-T)
*** Note the very small difference; small changes can have a dramatic impact on the emotional content of the music. :explanation:
*** Diminished (T-S, T-S)
*** Again, a very slight difference. In context, they each make us feel very different, despite a similar appearance on paper. :explanation:

** Scale degrees \( \hat{1} \hat{2} \hat{3} \hat{4} \hat{5} \hat{6} \hat{7}\)

*** So far, keeping track of tones and semitones feels a lot like book-keeping. It helps with finding the right notes on our instruments; it gives the most technically rigorous definition; but, it doesn't really help us to understand how and why these things /sound/ the way they do; why they /feel/ the way they do. What we're about to see may seem like yet more book-keeping, but it will actually help us understand why we hear things the way we do. :explanation:
*** Each part of the scale has a certain role to play for the emotional expression of the music in which it's found.
*** Build off the relative pitch ideas of the previous lecture - one scale is as good as another. Reuse that same activity with a major scale rather than 'take on me'. :activity:

*** TODO Check tag colour for tone/semitone, another colour for degrees

*** I haven't yet explained octave equivalence and how the scales just keep looping. :problem:

*** Make sure to add degrees /between/ the intervals

*** Minor scale, introducing altered degrees by comparison to major

*** DIY scales with playback that give altered degrees           :activity:


** Octaves: what happens when we get to 8?

** Chords, built from scales

*** Display scale degrees interleaved with intervals (T-S). When clicking a degree, highlight relevant notes, grey out irrelevant notes and play the chord arpeggio and together. Initially, only show one octave, but every time a chord that needs more notes is requested, extend out further. :activity:

*** "Each scale /coincides/ with certain chords, by sharing the same tone-semitone pattern". Emphasis on the coincidence - chords exist outside of scales. Chords generated using this method will only have notes that are present in the scale, so they are more stable (they don't "work better").
*** Much of the pop music we listen to relies on this stability to sound the way it does, so you'll find that many songs just use a few chords generated from one particular major scale.


** Chord degrees \(I\ ii\ iii\ IV\ V\ vi\ vii^o \)
 
*** Just as we numbered our scale degrees to reflect the fact each note has a role to play, consistent across different keys, so too does each chord based off of those notes. 

*** Rather than decorate the arabic numerals in a different way, we use roman numerals in instead. Simply by convention, upper-case represents major, lower-case represents minor, and the little circle represents diminished.
